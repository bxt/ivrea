### Instructional videos

* [A simple guide to electronic components.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Maq5IyHSuc): pretty cool recap of the vary basics, like what are resistors, capacitors, LEDs, diodes, transistors, explaining Ohm's law, ...
* [Datasheets: 16x2 LCD By Hand (No microcontroller)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXpeTxC3_A4&feature=emb_title): good example with lots of information on breadbord & IC basics, how to read datasheets, pull down/up resistors, button debounce.
* [Ben Eater (cannel)](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater): This has a lot of great info, as you can tell from the playlist titles «Building an 8-bit breadboard computer!», «Networking tutorial», «Build a 65c02-based computer from scratch
».
* [Don't Take Capacitors for Granted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr7bPmGTQUk): how to get polarity right.
