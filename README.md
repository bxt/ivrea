A place for my electronics and Arduino experiments. Warning: I have no idea what I'm doing here, so don't use this unless you know what you're doing.

## Resources

### Instructional videos

* [A simple guide to electronic components.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Maq5IyHSuc): pretty cool recap of the vary basics, like what are resistors, capacitors, LEDs, diodes, transistors, explaining Ohm's law, ...
* [Datasheets: 16x2 LCD By Hand (No microcontroller)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXpeTxC3_A4&feature=emb_title): good example with basic information on breadboard & IC basics, how to read datasheets, pull down/up resistors, button debounce.
* [Ben Eater (channel)](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater): This has a lot of great info, as you can tell from the playlist titles «Building an 8-bit breadboard computer!», «Networking tutorial», «Build a 65c02-based computer from scratch
».
* [Don't Take Capacitors for Granted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr7bPmGTQUk): how to get polarity right.
* [Beginner's Guide to Soldering Electronics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2Jf8cebwCs): explaining the various options and how poisonous they are.
* [Inside a Small Chinese Electronics Factory - From the Archives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF0E8WeEUVM&list=LL&index=6): How SMD components were printed on in a factory.
